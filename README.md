# Machine Learning in Medical Bioinformatics

This repository contains preparatory tasks, reading material and exercises for the Machine Learning in Medical Bioinformatics.

## Preparatory tasks (To be finished before the Workshop)

Many of the exercises will use Jupyter notebooks, an interactive Python environments that makes it possible to combine documentation with code.

* Read all of the instructions before starting.

* Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your laptop, choose the Python 3.6 version. This will install a special version of Python that includes the Jupyter Notebook and basically all Python modules needed (deep-learning modules that has to be installed separately).

* If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks you can learn more using the following tutorial: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook. 

* Download the excerises for the deep learning here: https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU/02456-deep-learning, and make sure that you can open the notebooks.

* Use a Jupyter notebook to do the first two tutorials on  [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/). Focusing on the key concepts outlined below. The goal with this exercise is that you should understand the key concepts, and familiar yourself with Jupyter notebooks.
