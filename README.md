# Machine Learning in Medical Bioinformatics

This repository contains preparatory tasks, reading material and exercises for the Machine Learning in Medical Bioinformatics.

## Preparatory tasks (To be finished before the Workshop)

Many of the exercises will use Jupyter notebooks, an interactive Python environments that makes it possible to combine documentation with code.

### Setup
* Read all of the instructions before starting.

* Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your laptop, choose the Python 3.6 version. This will install a special version of Python that includes the Jupyter Notebook and basically all Python modules needed (deep-learning modules has to be installed separately), see instructions here: https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU/02456-deep-learning.

* If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks you can learn more using the following tutorial: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook. 

* Git clone the excerises for the deep learning here: https://github.com/DeepLearningDTU/02456-deep-learning, and make sure that you can open the notebooks.

### Machine Learning Introduction
We will use the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) module to do machine learning in Python. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib and is fairly easy to use and it contains all the basic functions to do regular supervised and unsupervised learning. It contains a Neural network module as well, but it is fairly limited, so for neural nets we will use [Tensorflow](tensorflow.org) and the [Keras](keras.io) API

* Use a Jupyter notebook to do the first two tutorials on  [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/).
Focusing on the key concepts outlined below. The goal with this exercise is:

  * To understand the key concepts
  * Familiar yourself with Jupyter notebooks

Actions:

	* Write down descriptions for the concepts
	* Come up with at least three questions that can be discussed.
	* Think about cases were ML can be applied to your particular area (this can be used in the project later as well).

## Project
The project is the examining part of the course. Together with participation at the workshop it is compulsory to gain the course credits. The workload is expected to be about a week. The project is your chance to learn a bit more about some particular methods.
