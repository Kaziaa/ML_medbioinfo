# Machine Learning in Medical Bioinformatics

This repository contains reading material and exercises for the Machine Learning in Medical Bioinformatics.

## Preparatory tasks

* Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) choose the Python 3.5 version. This will install a special version of Python that includes the Jupyter Notebook and basically all Python modules needed (deep-learning modules that has to be installed separately).

* Many of the exercises will use Jupyter notebooks, an interactive Python environments that makes it possible to combine documentation with code.. If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks we suggest that you familiarize yourself before coming to the workshop using the following tutorial: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook.
