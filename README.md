# Machine Learning in Medical Bioinformatics

This repository contains reading material and exercises for the Machine Learning in Medical Bioinformatics.

## Preparatory tasks

* Many of the exercises will use Jupyter notebooks, an interactive Python environments that makes it possible to combine documentation with code. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) on your laptop, choose the Python 3.6 version. This will install a special version of Python that includes the Jupyter Notebook and basically all Python modules needed (deep-learning modules that has to be installed separately).


* If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks we suggest that you familiarize yourself before coming to the workshop using the following tutorial: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook.
