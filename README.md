# Machine Learning in Medical Bioinformatics

This repository contains reading material and exercises for the Machine Learning in Medical Bioinformatics. Many of the exercises will use Jupyter notebooks. If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks we suggest that you familiarize yourself before coming to the workshop using the following tutorial: (https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook). But very briefly Jupyter Notebooks are interactive Python environments that makes it possible to combine documentation with code.
